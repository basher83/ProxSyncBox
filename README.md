# Proxmox to NetBox Sync GUI

A desktop GUI application for synchronizing Virtual Machines (VMs), LXC
Containers, and Proxmox VE nodes (as Devices) from Proxmox environments to a
NetBox instance.

## Overview

This tool provides a user-friendly interface to connect to one or more Proxmox
VE nodes, fetch information about virtualized resources and the nodes
themselves, and then synchronize this data to NetBox. It helps keep your NetBox
inventory up-to-date with your Proxmox virtualization platform.

## Features

- **GUI Interface:** Easy-to-use desktop application built with PyQt6.
- **Multiple Proxmox Nodes:** Configure and switch between multiple Proxmox
  nodes.
- **VM/LXC Synchronization:**
  - Syncs VMs and LXC containers to NetBox Virtualization.
  - Maps Proxmox VM status to NetBox VM status.
  - Syncs vCPUs, memory, and primary disk size.
  - Syncs network interfaces, including MAC addresses, IP addresses (if static),
    and VLAN tags.
  - Syncs Proxmox tags to NetBox tags.
  - Extracts OS information from Proxmox notes (e.g., `os: Ubuntu 22.04`) or
    uses `ostype`.
  - Synchronizes detailed virtual disk information (name, size, storage ID, boot
    disk).
  - Populates various Proxmox-specific details into NetBox custom fields.
  - Advanced IP Address Discovery:
    - Identifies IP addresses statically configured on VM/LXC interfaces
      directly in Proxmox.
    - For running QEMU VMs, if a static IP is not found (e.g., VMs with DHCP),
      the application will attempt to retrieve active IP addresses by querying
      the **QEMU Guest Agent** installed in the VM. This ensures more accurate
      and up-to-date IP information in NetBox.
    - The first non-link-local IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) obtained will be used
      to set the primary IP for the VM in NetBox.
- **Proxmox Node to NetBox Device Synchronization:**
  - Syncs the Proxmox VE node itself as a "Device" in NetBox DCIM.
  - Allows mapping to NetBox Site, Device Role, Manufacturer, Device Type, and
    Platform.
  - Syncs node hardware details (CPU model, sockets, cores, total memory, root
    FS size) to custom fields.
  - Syncs node network interfaces (physical, bridges, bonds, VLANs) with their
    IP addresses to the NetBox Device.
- **Orphan Handling:** Marks NetBox VMs as "Deleted" (via a custom field) if
  they no longer exist in Proxmox.
- **Configuration Management:**
  - Settings dialog to manage global NetBox connection details and Proxmox node
    configurations.
  - Configurations are stored in a local `.env` file or managed via the GUI.
- **Logging:** View real-time logs of operations within the application.
- **Background Operations:** Long-running tasks (API calls, synchronization) are
  performed in background threads to keep the GUI responsive.

### Preserving Node Interfaces in NetBox

During the synchronization of a Proxmox node to a NetBox Device, interfaces that
exist in NetBox but are not found in the Proxmox node's configuration are
typically considered "orphaned" and are deleted by default.

However, ProxSyncBox will preserve interfaces in NetBox if their standard
boolean field `mgmt_only` (Management Only) is set to `True`. This is
particularly useful for out-of-band (OOB) management interfaces or other
specific logical interfaces that are tracked in NetBox but are not part of the
Proxmox node's manageable network configuration. These 'management only'
interfaces are not deleted during the node synchronization process due to their
specific nature, ensuring they remain in your NetBox inventory.

## Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Proxmox VE:** A running Proxmox VE environment with API access.
  - An API token for authentication is recommended.
- **NetBox:** A running NetBox instance (version 3.x or higher recommended) with
  API access.
  - An API token with appropriate permissions (read, create, update, delete for
    virtualization and DCIM components).

### Creating a Proxmox VE API Token

To allow ProxSyncBox to access your Proxmox VE data, you need to create an API
token. It's recommended to use a dedicated user and an API token with specific
permissions. The `PVEAuditor` role is generally sufficient for this application
as it primarily reads data.

1.  **Log in to the Proxmox VE web UI.**
2.  **Create a dedicated user (Optional but Recommended):**
    - Navigate to **Datacenter > Permissions > Users**.
    - Click **Add**.
    - Fill in the User name (e.g., `netbox_sync_user`), select Realm (e.g.,
      `pam` for local users or `pve` for PVE realm users), and set a password
      (though the password won't be used directly by the token).
    - Click **Add**.
3.  **Assign `PVEAuditor` Role to the User (or `root@pam`):**
    - Navigate to **Datacenter > Permissions**.
    - Click **Add > User Permission**.
    - Path: `/` (for access to the entire Proxmox VE instance).
    - User: Select the user you created (e.g., `netbox_sync_user@pam`) or
      `root@pam` if you choose to use the root user.
    - Role: Select `PVEAuditor`. This role provides read-only access to most
      objects.
    - Click **Add**.
4.  **Create the API Token:**
    - Navigate to **Datacenter > Permissions > API Tokens**.
    - Click **Add**.
    - **User:** Select the user for whom you assigned the `PVEAuditor` role
      (e.g., `netbox_sync_user@pam` or `root@pam`).
    - **Token ID:** Enter a descriptive name for the token (e.g.,
      `netbox_sync_token`). This will be your
      `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_TOKEN_NAME` in the `.env` file or GUI settings.
    - **Privilege Separation:** You can leave this unchecked for simplicity with
      the `PVEAuditor` role. If checked, the token would only have the
      permissions of the selected user _minus_ any privileges that require a TTY
      (like console access), which is fine for API usage.
    - **Expire:** Optionally, set an expiration date for the token. 0 means no
      expiration.
    - Click **Add**.
5.  **Important:** A window will pop up displaying the **Token ID** and the
    **Secret**.
    - **Copy the Secret immediately and store it securely.** This is your
      `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_TOKEN_SECRET`. **The secret will not be shown
      again.**

You will use the selected User (e.g., `netbox_sync_user@pam`), the Token ID, and
the Secret in the ProxSyncBox configuration.

### Creating a NetBox API Token

To allow ProxSyncBox to interact with your NetBox instance, you need to create
an API token.

1.  **Log in to your NetBox web UI.**
2.  **Navigate to your User Profile:**
    - Click on your username in the top right corner.
    - Select **Profile** from the dropdown menu.
3.  **Go to API Tokens:**
    - In your profile page, click on the **API Tokens** tab.
4.  **Create a New Token:**
    - Click the **+ Add a token** button.
    - **Label (Optional but Recommended):** Provide a descriptive label for the
      token (e.g., `proxsyncbox_token`).
    - **Expires (Optional):** You can set an expiration date for the token. If
      left blank, the token will not expire.
    - **Write enabled:** Ensure this box is **checked** if you want ProxSyncBox
      to create or update objects in NetBox. If you only want to read data (not
      typical for this tool's full functionality), you can leave it unchecked.
    - **Permissions:** For full functionality, the token will need permissions
      to create, view, change, and delete various objects. You can assign
      specific permissions or, for simplicity during initial setup, grant
      broader permissions. Key areas include:
      - `virtualization | virtual machine`
      - `virtualization | interface` (for VMs)
      - `virtualization | cluster`
      - `dcim | device`
      - `dcim | interface` (for Devices/Nodes)
      - `extras | tag`
      - And any other objects ProxSyncBox might interact with (e.g.,
        `ipam | ip address` if IP assignment is involved).
    - Click **Create**.
5.  **Important:** A window will display your new API token.
    - **Copy the token immediately and store it securely.** **This token will
      not be shown again.**

You will use this token as the `NETBOX_TOKEN` in the ProxSyncBox configuration.

**Tested Versions:**

- This application has been tested with NetBox version `4.3.1` and Proxmox VE
  version `8.4.1`. Compatibility with other versions is likely but not
  guaranteed.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ProxSyncBox
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages using the
    provided `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Proxmox API Permissions

For full functionality, including the discovery of IP addresses via the QEMU
Guest Agent, the Proxmox API token used by the application needs the following
permissions (or a role that includes them, such as `PVEVMAdmin`):

- `VM.Audit` (to read VM configuration)
- `VM.Monitor` (to interact with the QEMU Guest Agent, e.g., to get IPs)
- `Sys.Audit` (to read Proxmox node information)
- Other permissions may be required depending on operations (e.g.,
  `Datastore.Audit` for storage information).

## Configuration

The application settings are stored in a `.env` file in the application's root
directory. You can configure the application in two ways:

### 1. Via the GUI

- Launch the application.
- Go to **File > Settings**.
- **Global Tab:** Configure your NetBox URL, API Token, and the default NetBox
  Cluster Type name.
- **Proxmox Nodes Tab:** Add, edit, or remove Proxmox node configurations.
  - When adding/editing a node, you'll provide Proxmox connection details and
    specify how the node and its VMs should be represented in NetBox.
- Saving settings in the GUI will update the `.env` file.

### 2. Via the `.env` File (Manual Configuration)

If the `.env` file does not exist, the application will attempt to create an
empty one when you first run it or open settings. You can also create it
manually.

**Example `.env` file:**

```env
NETBOX_URL=https://netbox.example.com
NETBOX_TOKEN=your_netbox_api_token_here
NETBOX_CLUSTER_TYPE_NAME=Proxmox VE

**Parameter Explanations:**

**Global Settings:**

- `NETBOX_URL`: The full base URL of your NetBox instance (e.g.,
  `https://netbox.yourdomain.com`).
- `NETBOX_TOKEN`: Your NetBox API token.
- `NETBOX_CLUSTER_TYPE_NAME`: The name for the Cluster Type in NetBox that will
  be used for Proxmox clusters (e.g., "Proxmox VE"). Defaults to "Proxmox VE" if
  not set. This type will be created in NetBox if it doesn't exist.

**Proxmox Node Settings:**

Each Proxmox node configuration is prefixed with `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_`,
where `<ID_NAME>` is a unique identifier you define for the node configuration
(e.g., `PVE-CLUSTER-MAIN-NODE1` in the example).

- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_ID_NAME`: The unique identifier for this node
  configuration. **Must match the `<ID_NAME>` used in the prefix.**
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the Proxmox VE
  server.
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_NODE_NAME`: The actual node name as defined within
  Proxmox (e.g., `pve1`, `server01`). This is used in API calls to target the
  specific node.
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_USER`: The Proxmox user for API authentication (e.g.,
  `root@pam` or `your_api_user@pve`).
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_TOKEN_NAME`: The name of the API token created in
  Proxmox for the specified user.
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_TOKEN_SECRET`: The secret value of the Proxmox API
  token.
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_NETBOX_CLUSTER_NAME`: The name of the NetBox Cluster
  where VMs/LXCs from this Proxmox node will be grouped. If left empty, it
  defaults to the Proxmox `NODE_NAME`.
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_VERIFY_SSL`: Set to `true` or `false`. Whether to
  verify SSL certificates when connecting to the Proxmox API. Set to `false` for
  self-signed certificates (less secure).

_Optional fields for representing the Proxmox node itself as a Device in
NetBox:_

- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_NETBOX_NODE_SITE_NAME`: (Optional) The name of the
  NetBox Site to assign this Proxmox node (as a Device).
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_NETBOX_NODE_DEVICE_ROLE_NAME`: (Optional) The name of
  the NetBox Device Role (e.g., "Hypervisor", "Server"). Defaults to
  "Hypervisor".
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_NETBOX_NODE_MANUFACTURER_NAME`: (Optional) The name of
  the NetBox Manufacturer.
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_NETBOX_NODE_DEVICE_TYPE_NAME`: (Optional) The name of
  the NetBox Device Type (e.g., "Dell PowerEdge R740").
- `PROXMOX_NODE_<ID_NAME>_NETBOX_NODE_PLATFORM_NAME`: (Optional) The name of the
  NetBox Platform. If left empty, the application will attempt to use "Proxmox
  VE [version]" based on the fetched PVE version.

**Note:** Boolean values (`VERIFY_SSL`) should be `true` or `false`.

## Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed and configuration is set up (at least minimally
via GUI or `.env`), run the application from its root directory:

```bash
python gui_app.py
```

application to use them automatically._

## Screenshots

Here are a few glimpses of ProxSyncBox in action:

**Main Application Window:** ![ProxSyncBox Main Window](assets/ProxSyncBox.png)

## Operating System Support

This application is built with Python and PyQt6 and should run on any operating
system that supports Python and can install the PyQt6 library, including:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

## Troubleshooting

- **`urllib3` / `NotOpenSSLWarning` / `LibreSSL` Warning (macOS):** You might
  see a warning like:
  `NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with 'LibreSSL ...'`.
  This is common on macOS where Python's `ssl` module might be linked against
  LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL 1.1.1+. The application attempts to disable this
  specific warning for insecure requests (when `verify_ssl=false`). For
  production or secure environments, ensure your Python is compiled with a
  compatible OpenSSL version or manage certificates appropriately. The
  application should still function, especially if `verify_ssl` is set to
  `false` for Proxmox connections with self-signed certificates.
- **Connection Errors:**
  - Ensure the Proxmox host/IP, user, token name, and token secret are correct.
  - Verify network connectivity to your Proxmox and NetBox instances.
  - Check firewall rules.
  - If using SSL, ensure `verify_ssl` is set appropriately. For self-signed
    certificates on Proxmox, set it to `false`.
- **NetBox API Token Permissions:** Ensure your NetBox API token has sufficient
  permissions to create, read, update, and delete the relevant objects (VMs,
  interfaces, clusters, tags, devices, etc.).
- **Missing Custom Fields:** If data doesn't appear in certain NetBox fields,
  ensure the corresponding custom fields (as listed above) are created in NetBox
  with the correct content type and name.

## Dependencies

The core Python dependencies are:

- `PyQt6`: For the graphical user interface.
- `proxmoxer`: Python client for the Proxmox VE API.
- `pynetbox`: Python client for the NetBox API.
- `python-dotenv`: For managing settings in the `.env` file.
